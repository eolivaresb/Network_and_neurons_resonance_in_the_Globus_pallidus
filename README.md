# Network and Neurons Resonance in the Globus Pallidus

Code used in the paper _"Network and Neurons Resonance in the Globus Pallidus"_ (2025), *Journal of Neurophysiology*  
**Authors:** Erick Olivares & Charles Wilson

## System Requirements

The code was executed in **Linux** and **macOS** environments.

## Folder Structure

### `Network_code/`

Contains the basic code to run the network.  
Test files with neuron and network properties are located in the subfolder `simulation_files`.

### `Neurons_entrainment_Figure_1_2/`

Includes data, simulations, and analysis used to generate Figures 1 and 2.  
Raw electrophysiological data is not included due to its size but is available upon request.

### `peak_psd_delay_Fig_3_4_5/`

Contains code for data analysis and plotting of power spectral density and network coherence as a function of synaptic delay.  
Raw simulation data is omitted due to its large size and is available upon request.

Note: This folder includes code to simulate the **Hub** network. To simulate **small-world** or **random** networks, modify the network connectivity uploaded in `main.cpp`.

### `Sinewave_stimulation/`

Provides the code to stimulate the network with an external sinusoidal input and generate Figure 6 of the paper.
